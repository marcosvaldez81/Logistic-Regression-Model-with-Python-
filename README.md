# Logistic-Regression-Model-with-Python-

I created a Logistic Regression Model to analyze Customer Behaviors to click on an Facebook Ad. I did this with a CSV set that obtains users info such as time spent on FB, salary, home country and more. 

Used Libraries: 
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Seaborn 
  - Matplotlib.pyplot
  - from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
  - from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
  - from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression 
  - from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

Please make sure you download the CSV file and have it in same root as the jupyter notebook in order for it to work.
